### Case to be implemented
I need to write a program that allows the computer to guess a number by itself and then guess it in less than 20 tries

**Terms of the competition**
- The computer guesses a number by itself and then guesses it in less than 20 tries
- The algorithm defines the search space by binary narrowing

***Quality metric***
- The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1,000 repetitions
- A successful result is obtained by guessing in less than 20 tries

***What we practice***
- Learning to write beautiful code in Python
- Learning to work with IDEs
- Learning to work with GitHub

### Brief information about the data
- The computer thinks of a number for itself

### Stages of work on the project
- Write the game code based on the provided study materials and practice in Project_0
- Make a file with the game code, a file with the game call in Jupiter Notebook, a file with the project description and place it in the folder project_1
- Publish Project_1 on GitHub

### Result

The implemented game project provides a solution to the computer guessing the number in less than 20 tries


### Output

The implemented project provided a solution to the problem and allowed to practice skills of working with the IDE and GitHub environment
